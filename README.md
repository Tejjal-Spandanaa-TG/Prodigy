**Game Rules:** The game is played on a 3x3 grid. 
Player X always goes first. 
Players take turns to mark a cell in the grid with their symbol (X or O). 
The first player to get 3 of their symbols in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins the game. 
If all 9 cells are filled and neither player has 3 in a row, the game ends in a draw. Use the "Restart Game" button to start a new game at any time.
